# competitive-programming
Solutions of problems from ICPC regionals, mainly West Africa national contests
and South Africa regional.

## Why This Repository ?
At the moment we are writing these lines, we have participated to two editions
of the South Africa regional rontest. The judges did not publish explainations
and solutions to the problems, or at least we did not find them on the web.

So we decided to make a *little* effort to solve as many problems as we can
and publish solutions with explainations.

## Programming Languages Used
In a perfect world, we would give all the solutions in C++, because we think it
is the best language to use in programming contests. But the majority of the
participants from our country (Benin, if you are interessed) only use C, so when
it is possible, we give solutions in both C and C++. Sometimes we give
solutions in Python and Java too.

Note that you will need to compile the C programs with the option -std=c11 and
C++ programs with the option -std=c++11.

For Python, we use Python 3.
