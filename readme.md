# competitive-programming-africa
Solutions of problems from ICPC regionals, mainly West Africa national contests
and South Africa regional.

## Why This Repository ?
At the moment we are writing these lines, we have participated to two editions
of the South Africa regional contest. The judges did not publish explainations
and solutions to the problems :disappointed_relieved: or at least we did not
find them on the web.

So we decided to solve as many problems as we can and publish solutions with
explainations.

## Programming Languages Used
Solutions will be given in C, C++, Java and Python. Python and C++ are our
favourite languages, so most of the time, solutions will be given in those
languages.

Note that you will need to compile the C programs with the option -std=c11 and
C++ programs with the option -std=c++14.

For Python, we use Python 3.
