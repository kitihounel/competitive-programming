# competitive-programming
Solutions of problems from ICPC regionals, mainly West Africa national contests
and South Africa regional.

## Why This Repository ?
At the moment we are writing these lines, we have participated to two editions
of the South Africa regional contest. The judges did not publish explainations
and solutions to the problems :disappointed_relieved:, or at least we did not
find them on the web.

So we decided to make a *little* effort to solve as many problems as we can
and publish solutions with explainations.

## Programming Languages Used
In a perfect world, we would give all the solutions in C++, because we think it
is the best language to use in programming contests. But the majority of the
participants from our country (Benin, if you are interessed) only use C, so when
it is possible, we give solutions in both C and C++. Sometimes we give
solutions in Python and Java too.

Note that you will need to compile the C programs with the option -std=c11 and
C++ programs with the option -std=c++11.

For Python, we use Python 3.

### Update about programming languages (2017/07/19)
Python is now our main programming language. Solutions will be written in both
C++ and Python, but when we think that a solution will be tricky to write in
C++, we will only use Python. 

# IMPORTANT (2017/10/24)
It seems that there was an update on ICPC Live Archive platform, since our
submissions are now accepted. But sadly, a lot of our programs written in C are
not accepted because of compilation errors (They did not activate C11 support
for the compiler). So we will give all solutions for South Africa contest in
C++ and Python. But for West Africa contests, we will give solutions in C when
it is possible.
