# competitive-programming
Solutions for problems of ICPC regionals, mainly west african national contests and South Africa regional.

In a perfect world, we will give all the solutions in C++, because we think it
is the best language to use in programming contests. But the majority of the
participants in my country (Benin, if you are interessed) only use C, so when
it is possible, we also give solutions both in C and C++. Sometimes we give
solutions in Python and Java too.
