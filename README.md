# competitive-programming
Solutions for problems of ICPC regionals, mainly west african national contests and South Africa regional.

## Why this repository ?
At the moment I'm writing these lines, I have participated to two editions of
the South Africa Regional Contest. The judges did not published explainations
and solutions to the problems, or at least I did not find them on the web.

So I decided to write to publish the solutions to the problems I have solved
 during the contests and to make some research to find solutions to the problems
 I couldn't' solve (and publish them too).

## Programming Languages Used
In a perfect world, I would give all the solutions in C++, because we think it
is the best language to use in programming contests. But the majority of the
participants in my country (Benin, if you are interessed) only use C, so when
it is possible, we also give solutions both in C and C++. Sometimes we give
solutions in Python and Java too.
