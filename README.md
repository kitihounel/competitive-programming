# competitive-programming
Solutions for problems of ICPC regionals, mainly west african national contests and South Africa regional.

## Why This Repository ?
At the moment we are writing these lines, we have participated to two editions
of the South Africa Regional Contest. The judges did not published explainations
and solutions to the problems, or at least we did not find them on the web.

So we decided to make a *little* effort and to solve as many problems as we can
and publish them with explainations.

## Programming Languages Used
In a perfect world, we would give all the solutions in C++, because we think it
is the best language to use in programming contests. But the majority of the
participants from our country (Benin, if you are interessed) only use C, so when
it is possible, we also give solutions both in C and C++. Sometimes we give
solutions in Python and Java too.
